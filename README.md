# Web Design — Individual Assignment 🚀

Brief description: This is the individual-assignment version of a static front-end project. It includes multiple pages, scripts, and styles intended to showcase projects, skills, contact forms, and other course deliverables.

## Quick Start 🔧

Please run the project on a local server instead of opening files directly in the browser:

- Using Python 3 (run from the project root):

  ```bash
  python -m http.server 8000
  ```

- Or use the VS Code Live Server extension (recommended).

> **Important reminder (please comply)** ⚠️
>
> **Do not open `index.html` directly via the file protocol (`file://`) in a browser.**
>
> Opening files directly may cause resources to fail to load or certain features (such as JSON loading, fetch requests, or relative paths) to not work correctly. Always open the project through a local server. ✅
