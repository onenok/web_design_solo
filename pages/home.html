    <h1 class="home-hero">hi, I'm Ho Nok Hei — welcome to my portfolio</h1>
    <p>I am a software developer passionate about creating useful or even useless small programs, but most of the time I am gaming.<br>This website showcases my works, experiences, and contact information.</p>

        <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am a pragmatic software developer with no desire (or ability) to show off skills. I usually write programs to solve certain problems or because I find them interesting. I mainly use programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, C++, (HTML, CSS, if these two count as programming languages).<br>If you want to see my works, please visit my <a href="#project">Project page</a>. It would be even better if you could sponsor me.</p>

        <h2>Main but not very special features of this portfolio</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Responsive design, supporting both mobile and desktop browsing</li>
            <li>Dynamic navigation and "overflow menu" (a name I came up with; specifically, when the window width is insufficient to accommodate all navigation buttons, the rightmost overflowed navigation buttons are placed inside it.)</li>
            <li>works and resume summary</li>
        </ul>
